# What Should I Cook?

## Objective

_What Should I Cook?_ is a personal app of simple recipes. I've never been good at eating well: years spent in
high-pressure, high-paced environments have made eating takeout/delivery a too-easy fallback, and on the weeks I do
decide to cook, I over-buy and over-complicate what to make.

Key product features:

### Simple Recipes

* 5 or fewer steps
* 5 or fewer ingredients (excluding Pantry items, such as salt)
* 1 primary cooking method (e.g., roasting)

### Highly Filterable (for cravings and ease)

* Filter by ingredient
* Filter by taste (salty, sweet)
* Filter by texture (crunch, soft)
* Filter by time to cook
* Approximate calories

### Read, Save, Share

* Search for and open existing recipes
* Add and edit recipes
* Copy recipes to personal recipe book (later iterations)

### Tracking, Planning, & Suggestions

* My Kitchen section tracking ingredients currently in fridge
* Weekly meal planning for calories and groceries

## Roadmap

### v1 (in development)

* GUI in Tkinter
* Recipes in JSON
* View all recipes
* Filter recipes
* View single recipe in new window

### v2

* Recipes in MySQL database

### v3 and beyond

TBD.
